Here you can use use multiple esp8266 as a mesh communication . 1 esp8266 provide max connection 4 client . finally all mutiple end node sent data to router(esp8266) and taht esp8266 sent data to server via GPRS MODULE
This is a coe of ESP8266here youcan connect amny to many nodes without using repeates . 
Its a woderfull logic to use for implemented and its sucessfully work.
set ap mode ssid and passwords and also set same ssid and password in mesh program.
flash one AP(esp8266) for master and other mesh code flash on multiple end node(esp8266) and start communication 
dont worry for analysing you master received the MAC id of all end nodes. Do it and start the netword and make more reliable for future.
Good luck all of you !
