# ESP8266_MESH_MANY-to-MANY-NODES
Here you can use use multiple esp8266 as a mesh communication . 1 esp8266 provide max connection 4 client . finally all mutiple end node sent data to router(esp8266) and taht esp8266 sent data to server via GPRS MODULE
This is a code of ESP8266 here you can connect many to many nodes without using repeaters . 
Its a woderfull logic to use for implemented and its sucessfully work.
config/Set ap mode ssid and passwords@code and also set same ssid and password in mesh program.
flash one AP(esp8266) for master and other mesh code flash on multiple end node(esp8266) and start communication 
dont worry for analysing you master received the MAC id of all end nodes. Do it and start the mesh network and make more reliable for future.
Good luck all of you !
